## Getting Started

### Step 1: Upload Your Assessment

1. Click **"Upload Assessment"** in the dashboard
2. Drag and drop your PDF file (or click to browse)
3. Enter the **Unit Code** (e.g., BSBWHS332X)
4. Click **"Start Validation"**

**Tips:**
- Make sure your file is in PDF format
- File size should be under 50MB
- Use the correct unit code from training.gov.au

### Step 2: Wait for Processing

Your assessment goes through two stages:

**1. Document Processing** (30-60 seconds)
- AI reads and indexes your assessment
- Progress bar shows status

**2. Validation** (1-2 minutes)
- AI checks against all unit requirements
- You'll see "Processing in Background"

**What to do while waiting:**
- Keep the browser tab open
- Don't refresh the page
- You can upload more assessments

### Step 3: Review Results

Once complete, you'll see your validation results:

#### Status Indicators

**✅ Met** - Requirement is fully addressed
- Your assessment has appropriate questions/tasks
- Evidence is clear and sufficient
- No action needed

**⚠️ Partial** - Requirement is partially addressed
- Assessment touches on the requirement
- Evidence could be stronger
- Consider adding a smart question

**❌ Not Met** - Requirement is not addressed
- No evidence found in assessment
- Definitely add a smart question
- Review your assessment structure

---

### Step 4: Use Smart Questions

For each gap (Partial or Not Met), NytroAI generates a **Smart Question** you can add to your assessment.

#### How to Use Smart Questions

1. **Review the question** - Make sure it fits your assessment style
2. **Copy the question** - Click the copy button
3. **Add to your assessment** - Paste into your document
4. **Customize if needed** - Adjust wording to match your context

#### Regenerate Questions

Don't like the question? Click **"Regenerate"** to get a new one.

**Add context** to get better questions:
- "Focus on workplace safety"
- "Make it scenario-based"
- "Suitable for beginners"
