However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how to use a risk matrix to calculate a risk score, which is a key part of the requirement. The guide would benefit from adding a worked example of risk calculation.",

Section 2.3 (Page 18-20) explains the hierarchy of controls in detail with case studies. Appendix A (Page 45) includes a sample risk assessment form showing the structure and required fields.",
