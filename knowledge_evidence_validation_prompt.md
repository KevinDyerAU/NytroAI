   - Core concepts, ideas, and reasoning
   - Relationships between concepts
   - Application of theories to workplace contexts

2. **Factual Knowledge**
   - Definitions and terminology
   - Specific facts, data, or information
   - Classifications and categories

3. **Procedural Knowledge**
   - Steps in processes and procedures
   - How things work or are done
   - Sequences and workflows

4. **Regulatory and Compliance Knowledge**
   - Relevant laws, regulations, and standards
   - Industry codes of practice
   - Organizational policies and procedures

5. **Contextual Knowledge**
   - Industry context and trends

It ensures all children access high-quality education and care regardless of location."
  - **For process question**: "The five steps in risk management are: 1) Identify hazards, 2) Assess risks associated with hazards, 3) Control risks using hierarchy of controls, 4) Review effectiveness of controls, 5) Maintain records and documentation of the risk management process."

## Assessment Principles

- **Be lenient**: If questions are close enough and reasonably assess the knowledge requirement, mark it as "Met"
- **Focus on assessment quality**: Questions should effectively evaluate understanding, not just recall
- **Consider depth**: Assessment should match the qualification level and complexity of the requirement
- **Value variety**: Different question types (short answer, scenarios, case studies) can all assess knowledge
- **Assess coverage**: All aspects of the knowledge requirement should be addressed
- **Ensure clarity**: Questions should be clear and unambiguous

## Example JSON Output - Met

```json
{
  "requirement_number": "KE-003",
  "requirement_text": "Describe the purpose and components of the National Quality Framework (NQF)",
  "status": "Met",
  "reasoning": "This knowledge requirement is fully assessed through multiple questions. Question 2 (Page 6) asks learners to explain the purpose of the National Quality Framework and its importance in education and care. Question 3 (Page 7) requires learners to identify and describe the key components of the NQF including the National Law, Regulations, NQS, and learning frameworks. Question 8 (Page 10) includes a scenario requiring learners to apply NQF knowledge. Together, these questions comprehensively assess both the purpose and components aspects of the requirement.",
  "mapped_content": "Question 2 (Page 6): 'Explain the purpose of the National Quality Framework and why it is important for education and care services in Australia.' Question 3 (Page 7): 'Identify and describe the four key components of the National Quality Framework.'

Together, these components ensure consistent, high-quality education and care across Australia by setting clear standards, providing regulatory oversight, and guiding practice."

## Example JSON Output - Partially Met

```json
{
  "requirement_number": "KE-007",
  "requirement_text": "Explain the hierarchy of control and its application to workplace hazard management",
  "status": "Partially Met",
  "reasoning": "This knowledge requirement is partially assessed. Question 12 (Page 15) asks learners to list the five levels of the hierarchy of controls, which addresses knowledge of what the hierarchy is. However, there are no questions assessing learners' understanding of how to apply the hierarchy to workplace hazard management, or why certain controls are more effective than others. The requirement includes both explanation of the hierarchy AND its application, but only the first part is assessed.",
  "mapped_content": "Question 12 (Page 15): 'List the five levels in the hierarchy of controls in order from most effective to least effective.' This question assesses recall of the hierarchy levels but does not assess understanding of application or decision-making.",
  "citations": [
    "Knowledge Assessment, Part 3, Question 12: Hierarchy of Controls, Page 15"
  ],
  "unmapped_content": "Missing assessment of how to apply the hierarchy of controls to real workplace hazard scenarios. No questions assess learners' understanding of why elimination is more effective than PPE, or how to select appropriate controls based on the hierarchy. The application aspect of the knowledge requirement is not covered.",
  "recommendations": "Add a scenario-based question such as: 'A workplace has identified a chemical spill hazard. Using the hierarchy of controls, explain what control measures could be implemented at each level and which would be most effective.' Alternatively, expand Question 12 to require explanation of each level with workplace examples, not just listing.",
  "smart_question": "Explain the hierarchy of control and describe how you would apply it to manage the risk of repetitive strain injuries in an office workplace. Provide at least one example for each level of the hierarchy.",
  "benchmark_answer": "The hierarchy of controls ranks hazard controls from most to least effective: 1) Elimination - remove the hazard (e.g., automate repetitive data entry tasks), 2) Substitution - replace with something safer (e.g., use voice-to-text software instead of typing), 3) Engineering controls - isolate people from hazard (e.g., provide adjustable ergonomic workstations), 4) Administrative controls - change work practices (e.g., implement regular breaks, rotate tasks), 5) PPE - protect the worker (e.g., wrist supports). Apply by starting at elimination and working down the hierarchy, selecting the highest level control that is reasonably practicable for the specific hazard."
