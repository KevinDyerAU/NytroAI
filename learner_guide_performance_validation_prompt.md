**Requirement Number:** {{requirement_number}}
**Requirement Text:** {{requirement_text}}

## Learner Guide Performance Evidence Framework

The learner guide must provide comprehensive instruction, explanations, examples, and practice activities that prepare learners to demonstrate the required performance evidence. Unlike assessment tool validation, this focuses on whether the guide **teaches and prepares** learners for practical demonstration.

### Purpose of Learner Guide Performance Content

The learner guide should:

1. **Explain the Performance Requirement**
   - Clear description of what needs to be demonstrated
   - Explanation of why this performance is important in the workplace
   - Context for when and where this performance applies

2. **Provide Step-by-Step Instructions**
   - Detailed procedures or processes for performing the task
   - Sequential steps that guide learners through the performance
   - Tips, techniques, or best practices for successful performance

3. **Include Examples and Demonstrations**
   - Real-world examples of the performance being done correctly
   - Case studies or scenarios illustrating the performance
   - Visual aids (diagrams, photos, flowcharts) supporting understanding

4. **Offer Practice Opportunities**
   - Activities that allow learners to practice the performance
   - Exercises that build skills progressively
   - Self-check questions or reflection activities
   - Simulated scenarios for application

5. **Address Common Challenges**
   - Common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid
   - Troubleshooting guidance
   - Safety considerations or important warnings

## Validation Instructions

### 1. Gather Unit Performance Evidence Requirements
- Extract and understand the exact performance evidence requirement
- Identify what practical skills, tasks, or behaviors learners must be able to demonstrate
- Determine the context and conditions for this performance

### 2. Review Learner Guide Content for Alignment
- Search the learner guide for sections, explanations, activities, or examples that directly teach or demonstrate how to meet this performance requirement
- Look for:
  - **Instructional Content**: Explanations, procedures, step-by-step guides
  - **Examples**: Case studies, workplace scenarios, sample demonstrations
  - **Activities**: Practice exercises, simulations, self-assessment tasks
  - **Visual Aids**: Diagrams, flowcharts, photographs, illustrations
  - **Support Materials**: Templates, checklists, reference guides
- For each matched content item, note:
  - Section or topic title
  - Page number(s)
  - Learner guide name/version
  - Type of content (instruction, example, activity, etc.)

### 3. Map Performance Points to Learner Guide Content
- Map each aspect of the performance requirement to relevant learner guide content
- Identify which sections teach the necessary knowledge
- Identify which sections provide procedural guidance
- Identify which activities provide practice opportunities
- ALWAYS include page numbers in parentheses (e.g., "Section 4.2 (Page 22)")

### 4. Identify Content Gaps
- If the learner guide does not adequately prepare learners for the performance requirement, mark it as "Partially Met" or "Not Met"
- Identify what is missing:
  - Lack of instructional content explaining how to perform the task
  - Missing step-by-step procedures
  - No examples or demonstrations
  - Insufficient practice activities
  - Missing visual aids or supporting materials
- Provide specific recommendations for content to add

### 5. Assign Status
- **Met**: The learner guide fully explains and demonstrates how to meet the performance requirement, with adequate instruction, examples, and practice
- **Partially Met**: Some relevant content exists, but it does not fully prepare learners (e.g., explains theory but lacks practical steps, or provides steps but no practice)
- **Not Met**: No relevant instructional content is found in the learner guide

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Status
Does the guide provide instructions or practice activities for this performance?
- **Met**: Comprehensive preparation with instruction, examples, and practice

- Focus on practical "how-to" knowledge that enables performance
- Keep it concise and direct
- Examples:
  - "What are the three steps you must complete before starting the equipment?"
  - "How do you identify which control measures are required for the hazard?"
  - "What information must be documented when completing the incident report?"
  - "In what order should you perform the safety checks?"

### 8. Benchmark Answer
- Provide a concise, correct answer based on the learner guide's instructions
- Answer must be written in plain English
- Should reflect the content and procedures taught in the learner guide
- Include specific steps, actions, or key points from the guide
- Keep it focused and avoid unnecessary detail
- Examples:
  - "The three steps are: 1) Check the equipment is in off position, 2) Inspect for any visible damage or hazards, 3) Confirm all safety guards are in place and secure."
  - "Review the hazard identification chart in Section 3, determine the risk level using the risk matrix, then select control measures from the hierarchy of controls starting with elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE."
  - "Document the date, time, location, people involved, description of what occurred, injuries sustained, immediate actions taken, and supervisor notification details."

## Assessment Principles

- **Be lenient**: If content is close enough and provides reasonable preparation for the performance requirement, mark it as "Met"
- **Focus on preparation**: The guide should teach learners HOW to perform, not just explain WHAT the performance is
- **Value practice**: Guides with practice activities and examples are stronger than theory-only content
- **Consider learner perspective**: Would a learner who studies this content be prepared for assessment?
- **Assess completeness**: Does the guide cover all aspects of the performance requirement?
- **Recognize different formats**: Instruction can be provided through text, diagrams, videos, activities, etc.
