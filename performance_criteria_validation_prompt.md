# Performance Criteria Validation Prompt

Validate the following Performance Criterion against the provided Unit assessment documents to ensure competent performance is adequately assessed.

**Element/Criterion Number:** {{requirement_number}}
**Element (if applicable):** {{element_text}}
**Performance Criterion Text:** {{requirement_text}}

## Performance Criteria Framework

Performance criteria define what competent performance looks like. They specify the required standard of performance and the critical aspects that must be demonstrated to achieve competency. Assessment of performance criteria must focus on practical demonstration of skills in workplace-relevant contexts.

### Purpose of Performance Criteria Assessment

Performance criteria assessment should:

1. **Assess Practical Demonstration**
   - Require learners to actively perform tasks or demonstrate skills
   - Observe competent performance in context
   - Verify skills are applied correctly to workplace standards

2. **Evaluate Critical Aspects**
   - Assess the specific actions, decisions, or behaviors defined in the criterion
   - Verify performance meets required quality standards
   - Confirm consistency and reliability of performance

3. **Use Appropriate Assessment Methods**
   - Direct observation of performance
   - Practical demonstration tasks
   - Competency checklists aligned to criteria
   - Scenario-based assessments (only if other options are not suitable)

4. **Ensure Workplace Relevance**
   - Performance assessed in real or realistic workplace contexts
   - Tasks reflect actual workplace requirements and conditions
   - Evidence demonstrates work-ready competency

## Assessment Methods for Performance Criteria

Elements and performance criteria are assessed through practical demonstration using:

### 1. Direct Observation
- Watching the learner perform tasks in real or simulated environments
- Assessor directly observes and verifies performance against criteria
- **Example**: Observing the learner safely operate equipment following all safety procedures
- Most authentic method for assessing performance

### 2. Practical Demonstration
- Learner shows their skills in specific scenarios or tasks
- Performance completed under specified conditions
- **Example**: Demonstrating correct use of workplace machinery including setup, operation, and shutdown
- Allows assessment of complete processes and procedures

### 3. Competency Checklists
- Assessing tasks against set criteria using structured observation tools
- Observable behaviors mapped to performance criteria
- **Example**: Completing a step-by-step task assessment verifying each criterion is met
- Provides clear evidence of criterion achievement

### 4. Scenario-Based Assessments (only if other options are not suitable)
- Simulating real-world conditions to test responses and performance
- Realistic workplace situations requiring practical application
- **Example**: Handling an emergency situation following workplace procedures
- Used when real workplace assessment is impractical or unsafe

## Validation Instructions

### 1. Identify Matching Observations or Tasks
- **Search ALL provided documents** for tasks or observations that directly align with the Element or Performance Criterion
- **Consider the entire content** of each document systematically
- **EXCLUDE these specific sections**:
  - "Assessor Checklist" sections - these support evidence collection but cannot be used to meet performance criteria requirements
  - "Trainer Checklist" sections - these support evidence collection but cannot be used to meet performance criteria requirements
- **INCLUDE all other content** from documents, regardless of document name or type
- **Do NOT include knowledge questions** - only include tasks that require practical demonstration or performance
- **ONLY include student tasks** that explicitly require the learner to **perform the same action or response** as specified in the performance criterion
- For each relevant match, it is **mandatory** to include:
  - **Page number**
  - **Document name**
  - **Section name**
  - **Observation/Task Number**: The specific reference (e.g., Task 3.1, Observation Item 4, Activity 2)
  - Brief description of how the task/observation assesses the criterion
- If multiple tasks or observations align, list **all relevant matches** using the same format
- ALWAYS include page numbers in parentheses (e.g., "Task 3.1 (Page 15)")

### 2. Mark Gaps (Unmapped Content)
- Include "Unmapped Content" **only if** questions or tasks don't fully align with the Performance Criterion
- If gaps exist:
  - **Status**: Set to "Not Met" or "Partially Met"
  - **Explanation**: Briefly explain why the criterion was not fully addressed
  - Identify what specific aspects of the criterion are not assessed
  - Explain what type of assessment would be needed

### 3. Generate Smart Task and Benchmark Answer
- **Smart Task**: Create ONE practical task or observation checklist item that assesses this performance criterion
  - Must be a **practical or task-oriented requirement**, NOT a knowledge question
  - Should be observable and measurable by an assessor
  - Follow SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
  - Keep it simple and focused on demonstrating the performance criterion
  - Should require learners to perform the same action specified in the criterion
  - Examples:
    - **Direct Observation**: "Observe the learner follow workplace procedures for safe equipment operation, including all pre-operation checks, safe operating practices, and shutdown procedures."
    - **Practical Demonstration**: "Demonstrate the process for monitoring and responding to changes in client condition according to the provided care plan requirements."
    - **Checklist Item**: "Learner applies quality assurance processes and verifies completed work meets required standards using the workplace quality checklist."
    - **Scenario**: "In the simulated workplace scenario, handle the emergency situation following documented workplace procedures."
- **Benchmark Answer**: Describe the expected observable behavior that demonstrates competent performance
  - Written in plain English and focused on what the assessor should observe
  - Must directly address the smart task
  - Include specific actions, steps, or behaviors the learner should demonstrate
  - Avoid theoretical explanations - focus on observable performance
  - Should reflect competent achievement of the performance criterion
  - Examples:
    - **For observation task**: "The learner follows all documented workplace procedures for equipment operation. Pre-operation: inspects guards, checks emergency stops, verifies workspace clear. Operation: follows manufacturer instructions, maintains safe position, uses controls correctly. Shutdown: completes proper power-down sequence, secures equipment, completes safety checklist.

  - Suggested task: "Add Task [X]: Learner must [specific action matching criterion] while assessor observes and verifies [quality standards]"
  - Suggested observation: "Add Observation Item: Assessor verifies learner [specific performance] according to [standard/procedure]"
- For "Met": Use "None"

## Assessment Principles

- **Be lenient**: If tasks reasonably assess the criterion and require practical demonstration, mark it as "Met"
- **Focus on performance**: Assessment must require learners to DO the action specified in the criterion, not just know about it
- **Exclude checklists**: Assessor/Trainer checklists cannot be used to meet performance criteria requirements
- **Verify alignment**: Tasks must explicitly require the same action or response as the performance criterion
- **Consider methods**: Ensure appropriate assessment methods are used (observation, demonstration, checklist, scenario)
- **Assess authenticity**: Performance should be assessed in realistic workplace contexts
- **Value practical evidence**: Direct observation and practical demonstration are preferred over scenarios when possible
