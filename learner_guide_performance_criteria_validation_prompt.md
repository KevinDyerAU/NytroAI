# Learner Guide Performance Criteria Validation Prompt

Validate the following Performance Criterion against the provided Learner Guide documents to ensure learners understand what competent performance looks like.

**Element/Criterion Number:** {{requirement_number}}
**Element (if applicable):** {{element_text}}
**Performance Criterion Text:** {{requirement_text}}

## Performance Criteria in Learner Guides Framework

The learner guide must provide comprehensive content that helps learners understand what competent performance looks like for each performance criterion. Unlike assessment tools that evaluate performance, learner guides must **teach and prepare** learners to perform competently.

### Purpose of Performance Criteria Content in Learner Guides

The learner guide should:

1. **Explain the Performance Criterion**
   - Clear description of what the criterion requires
   - Explanation of what competent performance looks like
   - Context for when and where this performance applies
   - Why this criterion is important in the workplace

2. **Provide Step-by-Step Guidance**
   - Detailed procedures or processes for meeting the criterion
   - Sequential steps that guide learners through the performance
   - Tips, techniques, or best practices
   - Quality indicators or standards to aim for

3. **Include Examples and Demonstrations**
   - Real-world examples of competent performance
   - Case studies or scenarios illustrating the criterion
   - Visual aids (diagrams, photos, flowcharts) supporting understanding
   - Workplace contexts showing practical application

4. **Offer Practice Opportunities**
   - Activities that allow learners to practice skills
   - Exercises that build competency progressively
   - Self-check questions or reflection activities
   - Simulated scenarios for application

5. **Address Performance Standards**
   - Quality standards or benchmarks for competent performance
   - Common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid
   - Troubleshooting guidance
   - Safety or compliance considerations

## Assessment Methods Context

Elements and performance criteria are ultimately assessed through practical demonstration using:

1. **Direct Observation** - Watching learners perform tasks in real or simulated environments
2. **Practical Demonstration** - Learners showing their skills in specific scenarios
3. **Competency Checklists** - Assessing tasks against set criteria
4. **Scenario-Based Assessments** (only if other options are not suitable) - Simulating real-world conditions

The learner guide must prepare learners for these assessment methods by teaching them what competent performance entails.

## Validation Instructions

### 1. Content Mapping
- **Identify Relevant Content:**
  - Thoroughly review the learner guide to pinpoint sections, explanations, activities, examples, or exercises that align with the specific element and performance criterion
  - Look for content that teaches learners HOW to perform competently
  - Document each mapped content item with:
    - Section name or title
    - Page number(s)
    - Document name/guide name
    - Type of content (explanation, example, activity, visual aid)

### 2. Competency Alignment
- **Content Verification:**
  - Ensure each selected content item aligns with the performance criterion
  - Confirm content demonstrates or explains the required skills or actions for competency
  - Verify that explanations, examples, and activities meet the depth and context required
  - Check that content prepares learners to be assessed on this criterion

### 3. Identify Content Gaps
- **Mark Unmapped Content:**
  - If no content aligns with the criterion, mark it as "Not Met" or "Partially Met"
  - Identify what is missing:
    - Lack of explanation of what the criterion requires
    - Missing procedural guidance or steps
    - No examples showing competent performance
    - Insufficient practice activities
    - Missing quality standards or benchmarks
  - Provide brief explanation of gaps
  - Provide specific recommendations for content to add
  - **Do NOT include page numbers and document names in unmapped content section**

### 4. Originality and Specificity Check
- **Content Source Verification:**
  - Verify that mapped content is sourced directly from the learner guide
  - Do not reference external or generic sources
- **Language Specificity:**
  - Ensure content provides detailed explanations or examples related to the specific criterion
  - Avoid accepting generic descriptions that don't specifically address the criterion
  - Content should be contextually relevant to the workplace and qualification

### 5. Generate Smart Question and Benchmark Answer
- **Smart Question**: Create ONE simple question about how to perform a key aspect of this performance criterion
  - Question should test learner understanding of the procedures or processes taught in the guide
  - Should be answerable based on the learner guide content
  - Focus on practical "how-to" knowledge that enables competent performance
  - Keep it concise and direct
  - Examples:
    - "What are the key steps you must follow when operating equipment safely according to workplace procedures?"
    - "How do you respond to changes in a client's condition according to their care plan?"
    - "What process should you follow to apply quality assurance and verify your work meets standards?"
    - "Describe the procedure for handling an emergency situation in the workplace."
- **Benchmark Answer**: Provide a concise, correct answer based on the learner guide's instructions
  - Answer must be written in plain English
  - Should reflect the content and procedures taught in the learner guide
  - Include specific steps, actions, or key points from the guide
  - Keep it focused and avoid unnecessary detail
  - Examples:
    - "The key steps are: 1) Complete all pre-operation safety checks (guards, emergency stops, clear workspace), 2) Follow manufacturer operating instructions and maintain safe working position, 3) Complete proper shutdown sequence and secure equipment, 4) Document operation in equipment logbook."
    - "Monitor the client for changes, review their care plan to identify required responses, take appropriate immediate actions (comfort measures, vital signs), notify appropriate personnel as per escalation protocols, adjust care delivery as specified, and document all changes and actions taken."

### 6. Documentation
- **Page Number and Section Recording:**
  - Record learner guide page numbers corresponding to mapped content
  - Include section titles and headings
  - Verify page numbers correctly match the performance criteria content
  - ALWAYS include page numbers in parentheses in mapped content (e.g., "Section 3.2 (Page 18)")

  - Missing visual aids: "Add a flowchart or diagram illustrating the process for [criterion]"
- **Do NOT include page numbers and document names in recommendations**
- For "Met": Use "None"

## Assessment Principles

- **Be lenient**: If content is close enough and reasonably prepares learners for the criterion, mark it as "Met"
- **Focus on preparation**: The guide should help learners understand what competent performance looks like
- **Value practical guidance**: Guides with procedures, examples, and activities are stronger than theory-only content
- **Consider learner perspective**: Would a learner who studies this content know how to perform competently?
- **Assess completeness**: All aspects of the performance criterion should be addressed
- **Recognize different formats**: Instruction can be provided through text, diagrams, activities, examples, etc.
- **Verify specificity**: Content should specifically address the criterion, not just be generally related
