**Requirement Number:** {{requirement_number}}
**Requirement Text:** {{requirement_text}}

## Performance Evidence Framework

Performance evidence demonstrates competency through practical application in real or simulated workplace environments. It must be observable, measurable, and aligned with workplace requirements.

### Assessment Methods for Performance Evidence

Performance evidence is assessed through practical demonstration using these methods:

1. **Direct Observation**
   - Monitoring the learner performing job-related tasks in a real or simulated environment
   - Assessor directly observes and records performance against criteria
   - Example: Observing the learner perform a complex task with minimal supervision
   - Most preferred method for authentic performance assessment

2. **Practical Demonstration**
   - Learner demonstrates competency in applying required skills under various conditions
   - Performance completed under specified conditions (time, resources, supervision)
   - Example: Successfully completing a project task to meet required standards
   - Must demonstrate practical application, not theoretical knowledge

3. **Competency Checklists**
   - Evaluating specific performance criteria through structured observation checklists
   - Observable behaviors mapped to performance requirements
   - Example: Ensuring compliance with all operational safety steps during a procedure
   - Used in conjunction with observation or demonstration

4. **Scenario-Based Assessments** (only if other options are not suitable)
   - Assessing the learner's ability to respond to realistic workplace challenges
   - Simulated workplace situations requiring practical response
   - Example: Managing a simulated workplace hazard scenario
   - Must reflect authentic workplace conditions and requirements

## Validation Instructions

### 1. Collect Performance Evidence Details
- Extract and understand the exact Performance Evidence requirement
- Identify what practical skills, tasks, or behaviors must be demonstrated
- Determine the context and conditions under which performance should occur

### 2. Locate Matching Tasks or Observations
- Search the documents for assessment tasks, observations, or practical activities that require demonstration of this performance
- **Do NOT include knowledge questions** - focus only on practical demonstration requirements
- For each relevant match, you MUST include:
  - **Document name**
  - **Section name**
  - **Task/Observation Number** (e.g., Task 1, Observation Item 3, Practical Activity 2)
  - **Page numbers**
- If multiple tasks or observations align, list all relevant matches
- Look for:
  - Observation checklists
  - Practical demonstration tasks
  - Work-based projects
  - Simulated workplace activities
  - Role-plays or scenarios
  - Workplace documentation requirements that involve practical application

### 3. Mark Gaps (Unmapped Content)
- Include "Unmapped Content" **only if** no tasks or observations fully align with the Performance Evidence
- If gaps exist:
  - State what specific aspect of the performance requirement is missing
  - Explain why no relevant match exists
  - Provide specific recommendations for tasks or observations to address the gap

### 4. Create a Smart Task and Benchmark Answer
- **Smart Task**: Create ONE practical, task-oriented question or observation checklist item
  - Must be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
  - Must assess **practical demonstration**, NOT theoretical knowledge
  - Keep it simple and direct - avoid unnecessary wording
  - Target one specific performance requirement
  - Should be observable by an assessor
- **Benchmark Answer**: Describe the expected observable behavior
  - Written in plain English
  - Describe what the assessor should observe
  - Include specific actions, steps, or behaviors
  - Avoid theoretical explanations - focus on what is seen/done

### 5. Assign Status
- **Met**: Performance requirement is fully assessed through one or more practical tasks/observations
- **Partially Met**: Some alignment exists through tasks/observations, but gaps remain in coverage or depth
- **Not Met**: No relevant practical tasks or observations align with this performance requirement

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Status
Is this performance requirement assessed through practical demonstration?
- **Met**: Fully assessed with clear practical tasks/observations
- **Partially Met**: Partially assessed but lacks depth, coverage, or authenticity
- **Not Met**: Missing or only assessed through knowledge questions (not practical)

### 2. Reasoning (max 300 words)
- For "Met": Explain how the performance is adequately assessed with specific examples of tasks/observations
- For "Partially Met": Explain what is present AND what is missing or needs improvement
- For "Not Met": Detail why the performance is not adequately assessed and specific gaps
- Reference specific tasks, observations, or activities from the documents
- Focus on whether learners are required to **actively demonstrate** the specified performance

### 3. Mapped Content (max 250 words)
- What specific tasks, observations, or activities require the learner to demonstrate this performance?
- Include document names, section names, task numbers, and page numbers
- Provide brief descriptions of what the learner must do/demonstrate
- Format: "Task X (Page Y) requires demonstration of [performance]: '[brief description]'"
- **Do NOT include knowledge questions** - only practical demonstration requirements
- Use "N/A" if no relevant content found

### 4. Citations (array of strings)
- Provide an array of specific citations
- Each citation should include: Document name, Section/Task name, Task/Observation number, Page number(s)
- Format examples:
  - "Assessment Tool v2.1, Task 3: Practical Demonstration, Page 12-13"
  - "Observation Checklist, Item 5: Safety Procedure Performance, Page 7"
  - "Practical Activity Guide, Activity 2: Equipment Operation, Page 18-20"
- Use empty array [] if no relevant citations

### 5. Unmapped Content (max 200 words)
- What aspects of this performance requirement are missing or inadequately assessed?
- **Only include if Status is "Partially Met" or "Not Met"**
- For "Partially Met" or "Not Met":
  - State the exact Performance Evidence text that is not covered
  - Explain why no relevant practical task/observation exists
  - Identify gaps in performance demonstration requirements
- For "Met": Use "N/A"

### 6. Smart Task
- Generate ONE practical task or observation checklist item that assesses this performance requirement
- Must be a **practical or task-oriented requirement**, NOT a knowledge question
- Should be observable and measurable by an assessor
- Follow SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Keep it simple and focused on one requirement
- Examples:
  - **Direct Observation**: "Observe the learner prepare the worksite ensuring all safety barriers are correctly positioned and signage is visible."
  - **Practical Demonstration**: "Demonstrate the correct procedure for shutting down the equipment, including all safety checks and documentation."
  - **Checklist Item**: "Learner correctly identifies hazards and implements three appropriate control measures during the task."
  - **Scenario**: "Respond to the simulated customer complaint, demonstrating active listening and problem resolution."

### 7. Benchmark Answer
- Describe the expected observable behavior that demonstrates competent performance
- Written in plain English and focused on what the assessor should observe
- Must directly address the smart task
- Include specific actions, steps, or behaviors the learner should demonstrate
- Avoid theoretical explanations - focus on observable performance
- Examples:
  - **For observation task**: "The learner correctly positions safety barriers at minimum 2-meter perimeter around the work area, places 'Caution: Work in Progress' signs at two entry points, and confirms area is secure before commencing work. All actions completed without prompting."
  - **For demonstration task**: "The learner follows the shutdown sequence: 1) Stops operation using emergency stop, 2) Waits for complete cessation of movement, 3) Isolates power source and applies lockout, 4) Completes shutdown checklist form with time and signature, 5) Secures work area. All steps performed in correct order with safety protocols observed."

### 8. Recommendations (max 200 words)
- Provide actionable suggestions to improve performance evidence assessment
- **Only include if Status is "Partially Met" or "Not Met"**
- Examples:
  - Missing performance: "Add a practical task requiring learners to demonstrate [specific performance] in a workplace or simulated environment"
  - Insufficient demonstration: "Expand Task X to require learners to also demonstrate [missing aspect of performance requirement]"
  - Wrong method: "Replace knowledge Question Y with an observation task where assessors verify learners [perform action]"
  - Suggested task: "Add Task [X]: Learner must demonstrate [specific performance] while assessor observes [specific actions/behaviors]"
  - Suggested observation: "Add Observation Checklist Item: Assessor verifies learner demonstrates [specific performance] according to [standard/procedure]"
- For "Met": Use "None"

## Assessment Principles

- **Be lenient**: If content is close enough to the requirement and practical demonstration is required, mark it as "Met"
- **Focus on demonstration**: Performance evidence must involve practical doing, not just knowing
- **Emphasize observation**: Assessors must be able to observe and verify the performance
- **Ensure authenticity**: Performance should reflect real workplace conditions and requirements
- **Avoid knowledge questions**: Do not map to written/oral questions that only test theoretical knowledge
- **Consider context**: Performance should be assessed under conditions specified in the requirement
- **Verify assessment methods**: Confirm appropriate assessment methods are used (observation, demonstration, checklist, scenario)
