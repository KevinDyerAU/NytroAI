## Learner Guide Knowledge Evidence Framework

The learner guide must provide comprehensive content that enables learners to acquire the theoretical knowledge and understanding required for competent performance. Unlike assessment tool validation, this focuses on whether the guide **teaches and explains** the knowledge effectively.

### Purpose of Learner Guide Knowledge Content

The learner guide should:

1. **Explain Core Concepts**
   - Clear definitions and explanations of key terms
   - Descriptions of concepts, principles, and theories
   - Explanations of relationships between concepts
   - Context for why this knowledge is important

2. **Provide Detailed Information**
   - Comprehensive coverage of factual knowledge
   - Explanations of processes and procedures
   - Descriptions of regulatory and compliance requirements
   - Industry context and workplace application

3. **Include Examples and Illustrations**
   - Real-world examples demonstrating the knowledge
   - Case studies or scenarios illustrating application
   - Visual aids (diagrams, tables, flowcharts) supporting understanding
   - Workplace contexts showing practical relevance

4. **Support Learning and Understanding**
   - Information presented in logical sequence
   - Progressive building of knowledge
   - Activities or exercises to reinforce learning
   - Summaries or key points highlighting essential knowledge
   - References to additional resources or standards

5. **Address Different Learning Needs**
   - Clear, accessible language appropriate to learner level
   - Multiple explanations or approaches where helpful
   - Visual and textual content
   - Self-check questions or reflection activities

{
  "requirement_number": "KE-LG-009",
  "requirement_text": "Understanding of the hierarchy of control and its application to workplace hazard management",
  "status": "Partially Met",
  "reasoning": "The learner guide partially covers this knowledge requirement. Section 5.2 'Controlling Workplace Hazards' (Pages 38-39) lists the five levels of the hierarchy of control with brief one-sentence descriptions of each level. However, the content lacks depth in several areas: there is no explanation of why the hierarchy exists or why certain controls are more effective than others; no detailed explanation of how to apply the hierarchy to real workplace hazards; and no examples demonstrating selection of appropriate controls for different situations. The term 'hierarchy of control' is mentioned but the underlying principles and application methodology are not adequately explained for learners to develop full understanding.",
  "mapped_content": "Section 5.2 'Controlling Workplace Hazards' (Pages 38-39): Lists the hierarchy of control levels (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE) with one-sentence description of each. Figure 5.1 (Page 39): Pyramid diagram showing the five levels in order of effectiveness. The content addresses 'what' the hierarchy is but not 'why' or 'how to apply it'.",
  "citations": [
    "Learner Guide v3.1, Section 5.2: Controlling Workplace Hazards, Pages 38-39",
    "Learner Guide v3.1, Figure 5.1: Hierarchy of Control Pyramid, Page 39"
  ],
  "unmapped_content": "Missing explanation of the rationale behind the hierarchy - why elimination is most effective and PPE is least effective. No explanation of the decision-making process for selecting controls. Missing examples demonstrating application of the hierarchy to specific workplace hazards. No content explaining how to work through the hierarchy systematically or what 'reasonably practicable' means in this context. The application aspect of the knowledge requirement is not adequately covered.",
  "recommendations": "Expand Section 5.2 to include detailed explanation of why the hierarchy ranks controls from most to least effective, including concepts of reliability and worker dependence. Add a new subsection explaining the step-by-step process for applying the hierarchy to hazard scenarios. Include at least three worked examples showing how to apply the hierarchy to different types of hazards, demonstrating selection of controls at various levels. Add a case study where learners can see the decision-making process in action. Include Activity 5.1 with practice scenarios for learners to apply the hierarchy.",
  "smart_question": "Explain why the hierarchy of control ranks elimination as the most effective control measure and PPE as the least effective. Provide an example of each level applied to one workplace hazard.",
  "benchmark_answer": "The hierarchy of control ranks controls by reliability and effectiveness. Elimination is most effective because it completely removes the hazard, requiring no ongoing maintenance or worker compliance. PPE is least effective because it relies on workers using it correctly every time, can fail, and only protects the individual wearing it. Example for manual handling hazard: Elimination - automate the lifting task; Substitution - use lighter materials; Engineering - install mechanical lifting aids; Administrative - implement team lifting procedures and training; PPE - provide back support belts. Higher controls are preferred because they protect more reliably."
